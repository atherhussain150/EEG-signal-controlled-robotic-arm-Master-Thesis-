1. ANT Neuro - EEG data collection device
2. using 64 electrodes
3. Data is in MAT file, each MAT file is of 2 seconds. Initially we collect 20 second data which are then truncated to 6 seconds.
   From those 6 seconds, we take from the 3rd second to 5th second for processing. Other than this data, we also use realtime data 
   Which is of 2 seconds, which reflects real-life thought processing.
4. Single participant for data collection, and data is being collected until the model achieves 80% accuracy.
5. For error correction, we are using sparse categorical (labelled data with discrete states, i.e push, pull and nothing where states are identified as integers) cross-entrophy.
   In categorical cross-entrophy, the states are objects, i.e. 'push', 'pull' and 'nothing'. And sparse categorical cross-entrophy is used with integer labelling. WE USE SPARSE CATEGORICAL CROSS-ENTROPHY.
6. ADAM optimizer is being used for converging the model according to the error criteria (which is sparse categorical cross-entrophy).
7. The number of interations our models takes to converge is 5 epochs. Labelling for classification is; no-movement: 0, movement: 1.
8. We are using Convolution neural network (CNN), using 3 layers, without dense layer, 2 max pooling layers, 1 global average pooling layers.
9. Input shape of data fed to the classifier: From the 2 sec MAT file, with 512 sampling freq, we get 1024 samples from the 2 second file. We take first 0 to 1000 samples from that and actually use every alternate samples from the 1000, down-sampling the data, making actual processed samples 500.
   These 500 samples are used across all 64 channels.
10. Data is normalized using scaling, by removing first 20 and last 20 percentile: gausian curve (bell curve) ,
    we make the epoch to be 0 mean unit-variance, after removing the outliers. Diagram?
11. We are not extracting any features, but feeding the pre-processed data to the model because since we are using CNN mode, the model is known to extract features automatically.
12. Total data we have is 3600 MAT files, from which we use 70% we use for training and 30% for testing.
